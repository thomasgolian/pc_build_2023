# pc_build_2023
*Scroll down to view build process w/ photos.* My new PC rig at home for work, virtualization, &amp; gaming! A modest mid-level ATX mid-size tower build, intel mb. I hadn't had a tower pc for over 5 years, so this was my first tower in a while. I was so excited that I built everything in less than 48 hours, even though I was rusty! This motherboard is LGA 1700 intel socket, and I built PC with upgrade path in mind = upgrade to a Intel 13th gen i7 or i9 in a few years, along with a new gpu. Might have to replace power supply for one with more watts, depending on how much power the new cpu and gpu require, when I upgrade in future. 

1) Selecting hardware components: I build this PC while studying for the CompTIA A+ and it was a short-timeframe build... Meaning the primary goal was to get a pc built up-and-running quickly, with little time to shop for the best component & price. Speed > optimum build and price for this project. I shopped for components in less than 48 hours.

Final selection was:
<p>12th gen Intel core i5 CPU
<p>nvidia geforce RTX 3070ti 
<p>corsair rgb 120mm x1 fan
<p>EVGA Super Nova 750 watt, 80 Plus Gold rating
<p>Cooler Master Hyper 212 cpu heat sink air cooler
<p>Corsair Vengeance RGB pro 32gb (2x16gb) DDR4 RAM
<p>Corsair 4000D Airflow tempered glass case, mid-tower atx form factor
<p>MSI z690 Edge Wifi DDR4 Gaming Motherboard
<p>Noctua nf-p12 redux 120mm case fan x1
<p>corsair SP140 RGB pro, 2x 140mm fans
<p>Samsung 970 EVO SSD 2TB NVMe M.2 slot
<p>Noctua thermal paste for CPU heat sink 
<p>hyper X alloy origins mechanical keyboard
<p>Windows 11 OS
<p>And the GPU in photo below (gigabyte 3060) wasn't quite big enough for what I wanted - returned & changed GPU to the nvidia 3070ti.
 
2) Gathered up all the hardware and started building!

  3) Started with the case. Removed both default 120mm fans that came with case. Decided to go with 2x 140mm fans in front for intake. Placed 2x 120mm fans, one on top and on one back for exhaust.

  4) As marketed, the 4000D case has great airflow on all sides of the chassis. The top has a magnetic filter screen that you can keep or remove (I remove it when PC is on because I have top exhaust fan, put it back on when PC is off to keep unnecessary dust out).

  5) Some nice 140mm fans! RGB enabled if needed. Mounted both fans for air intake into the case

  6)Really cool fun motherboard. Researched all the right header pins on mb to make sure all my components were matched to correct headers. (don't want to fry a component!) I wanted a WiFi enabled mb because my apartment is small and router is close by. Good WiFi performance with it and no need for me to have any direct ethernet connection right now. mb has many slots and features, more than I need. Should serve me a long time.

  7)Unpacked mb, read some instructions to make sure I didn't miss anything. First step: insert the intel cpu, apply thermal paste in a 5-dot pattern, mount heat sink.
