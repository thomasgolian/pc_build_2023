# pc_build_2023
*Scroll down to view build process w/ photos.* My new PC rig at home for work, virtualization, &amp; gaming! A modest mid-level ATX mid-size tower build, intel mb. I hadn't had a tower pc for over 5 years, so this was my first tower in a while. I was so excited that I built everything in less than 48 hours, even though I was rusty! This motherboard is LGA 1700 intel socket, and I built PC with upgrade path in mind = upgrade to a Intel 13th gen i7 or i9 in a few years, along with a new gpu. Might have to replace power supply for one with more watts, depending on how much power the new cpu and gpu require, when I upgrade in future. 


1) Selecting hardware components: I build this PC while studying for the CompTIA A+ and it was a short-timeframe build... Meaning the primary goal was to get a pc built up-and-running quickly, with little time to shop for the best component & price. Speed > optimum build and price for this project. I shopped for components in less than 48 hours.


Final selection was:
<p>12th gen Intel core i5-12400 cpu
<p>nvidia geforce RTX 3070ti 
<p>corsair rgb 120mm x1 fan
<p>EVGA Super Nova 750 watt, 80 Plus Gold rating
<p>Cooler Master Hyper 212 cpu heat sink air cooler
<p>Corsair Vengeance RGB pro 32gb (2x16gb) DDR4 RAM
<p>Corsair 4000D Airflow tempered glass case, mid-tower atx form factor
<p>MSI z690 Edge Wifi DDR4 Gaming Motherboard
<p>Noctua nf-p12 redux 120mm case fan x1
<p>corsair SP140 RGB pro, 2x 140mm fans
<p>Samsung 970 EVO SSD 2TB NVMe M.2 slot
<p>Noctua thermal paste for CPU heat sink 
<p>hyper X alloy origins mechanical keyboard
<p>Windows 11 OS
<p>And the GPU in photo below (gigabyte 3060) wasn't quite big enough for what I wanted - returned & changed GPU to the nvidia 3070ti.
 
 
2) Gathered up all the hardware and started building!

  3) Started with the case. Removed both default 120mm fans that came with case. Decided to go with 2x 140mm fans in front for intake. Placed 2x 120mm fans, one on top and on one back for exhaust.

  4) As marketed, the 4000D case has great airflow on all sides of the chassis. The top has a magnetic filter screen that you can keep or remove (I remove it when PC is on because I have top exhaust fan, put it back on when PC is off to keep unnecessary dust out).

  5) Some nice 140mm fans! RGB enabled if needed. Mounted both fans for air intake into the case

  6)Really cool fun motherboard. Researched all the right header pins on mb to make sure all my components were matched to correct headers. (don't want to fry a component!) I wanted a WiFi enabled mb because my apartment is small and router is close by. Good WiFi performance with it and no need for me to have any direct ethernet connection right now. mb has many slots and features, more than I need. Should serve me a long time.

  7)Unpacked mb, read some instructions to make sure I didn't miss anything. First step: insert the intel cpu, apply thermal paste in a 5-dot pattern, mount heat sink.

 8) For good measure and practice, since I hadn't worn an anti-static band before, I used one when inserting cpu and RAM. Though unlikely to get ESD, I wore it anyone. Most of the time just touching metal case. I also forgot to take pictures of my thermal paste, but everything went smoothly. (and my cpu temp has been running fine low temperatures when under heavy gaming load, so I imagine my thermal paste application is correct and working as intended with the heat sink)

 9) Screwed heatsink onto motherboard after applying paste.

 10) After heat sink attached, I attached the clip-on 120mm fan to the side of the heat sink, intaking air from case and blowing through the metal fins, exhausting the air directly into the airflow path of the rear case fan. With the clip-on fan attached to the heatsink, I can use 3 of 4 RAM slots. If I ever need the 4th RAM slot closest to the cpu, I'll need to remove the heatsink fan, which would be probably be fine given the good airflow already.

 11) Mounted mb properly to case. I installed the GPU (although I later replaced with a different one, as well as more cable management to clean up case interior). Properly connected all power cables to power supply that resides in lower case compartment. Having the power supply underneath and out of the way, makes the interior of the case nice and clean, neat, and nice to look at! Booted up power and UEFI/BIOS to check integrity.

 12) Cable Management. This case like many others recently have nice side enclosed panel to direct cable/cord flow to the side compartment, minimizing how many wires are clogging up the interior motherboard space. This was the first case I owned with this type of cable management, and it was super fun to optimize cable management and make everything clean. A few adjustments over time were added to continue to managed cables.

 13)Replaced rear default black fan with a rgb 120mm fan.

 14) installing nvidia 3070ti. Nothing too crazy. Solid mid level current gpu with plenty of graphics power for what I need. I only game on occasion, so this gpu investment is plenty for what I want. Although, I'll probably get something 'beefier' in 3-5 years.

 15) Fired up the UEFI again, made sure everything was good. I also customized my fans curse. Minimized fan speeds to minimum and the curve only increases fan speeds when the CPU and GPU get hot enough. Goal is to make fans last as long as possible, and decrease noise. The fans run at around 600rpms when cpu is idle, and range up to 1200rpm when under load. The 140mm fans run slightly slower than the 120mm fans because the larger fans push more air. Thus to create balanced airflow from intake to exhaust, I customized curves to make sure there was a slightly higher intake than exhaust if anything. Nice and balanaced. I did not want to create any negative airflow. Positive airflow for this build.

 16) At this point, I finished the build. Plenty of exta slots, compartments, storage area for more drives, plenty of mb slots for more RAM, more M.2 slots, plenty of room and choices to tinker with the build in the future! The rest of the images below are different RGB color combos! Normally, I like minimum rgb, because too much lighting can be gaudy! Nonetheless, I was excited and took some different photos with different lighting combinations. fun! Everything with the build went smoothly with no issues.
